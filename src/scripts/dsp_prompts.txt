For how many positive integers $n$ is $n^2 - 3n + 2$ a [[prime]] number?

$\mathrm{(A)}\ \text{none}
\qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}

\qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ \text{more\ than\ two,\ but\ finitely\ many}
\qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ \text{infinitely\ many}$ Show that it is \mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}.

### Solution

Factoring, we get $n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n-2)(n-1)$. 
Either $n-1$ or $n-2$ is odd, and the other is even.  
Their product must yield an even number.  
imoThe only prime that is even is $2$, which is when $n$ is $3$ or $0$.
Since $0$ is not a positive number, the answer is $\mathrm{(B)}\ \text{one}$.*)

For a positive real number a, show that $10a\leq 28a^2+1$.

### Solution

It suffices to show $0\leq 28a^2 - 10a + 1$.
First, consider completing the square for $28a^2 - 10a$ and observe that $(a - \frac{5}{28})^2 = a^2 - \frac{10}{28}a + (5/28)^2$.
Since $0\leq (a - \frac{5}{28})^2$, we have $0\leq a^2 - \frac{10}{28}a + (5/28)^2$.
Multiplying by 28 and simplifying terms gives $0\leq 28*a^2 - 10*a + (25/28)$.
Since $25/28 < 1$, the result follows.*)

### Solution

First notice that $2x$ is positive.
It suffices to show $\sqrt{2} \leq x + \frac{1}{2x}$.
Let $y = \sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$.
Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \geq 0$.
Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \frac{1}{2x} - \sqrt{2})$.
Therefore $x + \frac{1}{2x} - \sqrt{2} \geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.

Informal:
(*### Problem

Show that for any positive integer $n$, we have $3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \pmod{2^{n+3}}$.

### Solution

We prove by induction on n. The base case is trivial.
Inductive case: when n is 0 it is also trivial.
When $n>0$, let $m=2^n$, and we have $3^m - 1 \equiv 4*m \pmod{8*m}$.
Then there is $k$ where $3^m - 1 = (8*m)*k + 4*m$.
Let $M = 4*m*k^2+m+4*m*k+k$, and we have $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 = 3^{m*2} - 1 = (3^m)^2-1 = ((8*m)*k + 4*m+1)^2 - 1 = (16*m)*M + 8*m$
Hence $3^{2^{m+1}}-1 \equiv 8*m \pmod{16*m}$, which unfolds to $(16*m)*M + 8*m \equiv 8*m \pmod{16*m}$.
Therefore the inductive case holds. Q.E.D.*)

We simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.
Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8.
We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number.
Hence $a$ is 1.

We can rewrite $xyz=1$ as $\frac{1}{z}=xy$.

Substituting into one of the given equations, we have
